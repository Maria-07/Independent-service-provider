          <span className=" text-6xl">&#8220;</span> I am from Britain and think
          it is right that as a woman I am paid the same as my male
          counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make
          decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be
          involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my
          country. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same
          respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in
          the world where all women can expect to receive these rights. In 1995,
          Hilary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women rights.
          Sadly many of the things she wanted to change are still a reality
          today. No country in the world can yet say they have achieved gender
          equality. I am reaching out to you because I need your help. We want
          to end gender inequality. To to do that we need everyone to be
          involved."
